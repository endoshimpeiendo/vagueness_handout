abstract = {Game-theoretic ideas have long played an influential rule in analyzing various branches of logic. This chapter focuses on using modal logics to describe and reason about games. It also investigates the uses of modal logic. Some structure on the various strands of research, to create an organization, which highlights the essential lines of research are focused. The chapter also discusses modeling imperfect information and multi-agent information update through dynamic epistemic logics; reasoning about game structure through operations for combining games; and logics of collective action and the power of coalitions of agents over time. Game trees can be viewed as Kripke models, where the possible moves are modeled by an accessibility relation and additional information about payoffs and turn taking are encoded by propositional atoms. Structural equivalence notions such as bisimulation turn into game equivalence notions, and extensions of the modal language, which can capture game-theoretic solution concepts such as the subgame-perfect equilibrium are investigated.},

First of all, the ultraproduct construction is adapted for {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}-additive probability models, and subsequently when this class of models is considered it is shown that the compactness property holds with respect to a fragment of {\$}PL{\$} called basic probability logic ({\$}BPL{\$}). On the other hand, when dealing with finitely-additive probability models, one may extend the compactness property for a larger fragment of probability logic, namely positive probability logic ({\$}PPL{\$}).

(See quote page 8) (I have the suspicion that this is already a foretaste of what is going to be the critique of racism and sexism - that their distinctions track the "wrong" differences.)$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* sex distinctions have a social function (purposes of sorting) and are usually socially motivated, but this does not necessarily imply that the difference between sexes is social, i.e. that the differentiated objects that these distinctions are supposed to track are socially constituted or socially caused (unless we include under social constitution the feature of being distinguished according to certain social purposes - probably not hard to find an example where this leads to reductio ad absurdum)$\backslash$n-{\textgreater} concluding from the social function and/or motivation of sex distinctions that sex differences are social would mean to make an inference/transfer from kind of distinction (natural/social) to kind of difference (natural/social), which is not, in general, valid: if biological or anatomical distinctions are socially motivated, it may still be the case that the conditions we settle upon for being male or female may be ones that only make reference to anatomical features$\backslash$n-{\textgreater} the interesting thing is that the purpose for distinguishing sex/"color" and gender/race can make a difference as to whether sex/"color" and gender/race are socially constructed because, depending on the distinctions and thus the differences that we suppose as a result of our purposes, social features can be a condition for differentiating sex/"color" and/or gender/race or not; still there is no transfer from the quality of being social from the distinction onto the respective features$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCOLOR and SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* race is the social meaning of "color" ("color" = not only skin color, but also those features in a particular context that mark the body as having presumed ancestral origins in a particular region of the world, e.g. eye, nose, and lip shape, hair color and texture, height, and physique)$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLITERATURE: Haslanger(2012 [2000]) - on the question of whether "color" socially constructed$\backslash$n$\backslash$n* assume both "color" and race categories are socially distinguished, but are "color" differences socially constituted or socially caused?$\backslash$n-{\textgreater} features that form the basis for racial classification in most contexts involve the social history of the appearance in question: same individuals in terms of skin colour, eye},

Quine, two of the twentieth century's most important philosophers, corresponded at length--and over a long period of time--on matters personal, professional, and philosophical. Their friendship encompassed issues and disagreements that go to the heart of contemporary philosophic discussions. Carnap (1891-1970) was a founder and leader of the logical positivist school. The younger Quine (1908-) began as his staunch admirer but diverged from him increasingly over questions in the analysis of meaning and the justification of belief. That they remained close, relishing their differences through years of correspondence, shows their stature both as thinkers and as friends. The letters are presented here, in full, for the first time.$\backslash$nThe substantial introduction by Richard Creath offers a lively overview of Carnap's and Quine's careers and backgrounds, allowing the nonspecialist to see their writings in historical and intellectual perspective. Creath also provides a judicious analysis of the philosophical divide between them, showing how deep the issues cut into the discipline, and how to a large extent they remain unresolved.$\backslash$nDear Carnap, I enclose a copy of a paper which I am ready to send off for publication. . . . I am anxious to have you look this over as soon as possible, to see whether you have reason to suppose the system contradictory: for it looks dangerous.$\backslash$nDear Quine: I read your paper very carefully and with the highest interest. . . .

The chapters in this volume approach the question of how to do philosophy from a wide range of perspectives, including conceptual analysis, critical theory, deconstruction, experimental philosophy, hermeneutics, Kantianism, methodological naturalism, phenomenology, and pragmatism. They explore general conceptions of philosophy, centred on the question of what the point of philosophizing might be; the method of conceptual analysis and its recent naturalistic critics and competitors; perspectives from continental philosophy; and also a variety of methodological views that belong neither to the mainstream of analytic philosophy, nor to continental philosophy as commonly conceived. Together they will enable readers to grasp an unusually wide range of approaches to methodological debates in philosophy.},

The leading formal treatments of such indeterminacy—three valued logic, supervaluationism, etc.—either fail to validate the classical theorems, or require that various classically valid inference rules be restricted. Here we show how a fully classical, yet indeterminist account of vagueness can be given within natural semantics, an alternative semantics for classical proof theory. The key features of the account are: there is a single notion of truth—definite truth—and a single notion of validity; sentences can be true, false, or undetermined; all classical theorems and all classical inference rule are valid; the sorites argument is unsound; ‘definitely' is treated as a meta-language predicate; higher-order vagueness is handled via semantic ascent.},

@incollection{Haraway1991,
abstract = {from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A{\_}Cyborg{\_}Manifesto A Cyborg Manifesto is an essay written by Donna Haraway. Haraway began writing the Manifesto in 1983 to address the Socialist Review request of American socialist feminists to ponder over the future of socialist feminism in the context of the early Reagan era and the decline of leftist politics. The first versions of the essay had a strong socialist and European connection that the Socialist Review East Coast Collective found too controversial to publish. The Berkeley Socialist Review Collective published the essay in 1985 under the editor Jeff Escoffier. The essay is most well known for being published in Donna Haraway's 1991 book Simians, Cyborgs and Women. $\backslash$nDonna Haraway's essay is an attempt to break away from Oedipal narratives and Christian origin doctrines like Genesis; the concept of the cyborg is a rejection of rigid boundaries, notably those separating "human" from "animal" and "human" from "machine." In A Cyborg Manifesto, she writes: "The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust." $\backslash$nThe Manifesto criticizes traditional notions of feminism—particularly its strong emphasis on identity, rather than affinity. She uses the metaphor of a cyborg to urge feminists to move beyond the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics.[2] Marisa Olson summarized Haraway's thoughts as a belief that there is no distinction between natural life and artificial man-made machines.},

Tracing the gendered roots of science in culture, Donna Haraway's writings about scientific research on monkeys and apes is arguably the fmest scholarship in this tradition. She has carefully studied the publications, the papers, the correspondence, and the history of the expeditions and institu- tions of primate studies, uncovering the historical construction of the pedigrees for existing social relations - the naturalization of race, sex, and class. Throughout this book she is analysing accounts, narratives, and stories of the creation of nature, living organisms, and cyborgs (cybernetic organ- isms: systems which embrace organic and technological components). She also looks critically at the immune system as an information system, and shows how deeply our cultural assumptions penetrate into allegedly value- neutral medical research. In several of these essays she explores and develops the contested terms of reference of existing feminist scholarship; and by mapping the fate of two potent and ambiguous words - 'nature' and 'experience' - she uncovers new visions and provides the possibility of a new politics of hope},

abstract = {Do counterfactual conditionals have truth-values? If so, what are the truth-conditions of counterfactuals? Do such conditionals constitute a logically distinct subclass of conditionals in general, and if so, how do they differ logically from other conditionals? That is to say, how, if at all, does the logic of counterfactuals differ from the logic of other con- ditionals, in respect of the patterns of valid inference in which coun- terfactuals are involved? Is it correct to think of counterfactuals as belonging to a wider class of 'subjunctive' conditionals, whose truth- conditions and logic differ fundamentally from those of so-called 'indicative' conditionals - or is this grammatical distinction of mood either inapplicable to conditionals or at best something of merely prag- matic significance? Is the conditional connective 'if..., then -- ' really ambiguous? All of these questions need to be answered if we are to arrive at the truth about counterfactuals. Let me begin by laying my cards on the table. First, I do not think that 'if' is ambiguous. Nor do I think that the subjunctive/indicative distinction, as applied to conditionals, is semantically or logically important. I believe that there is a single, unified logic of conditionals. And I believe that conditionals do, in general, have truth-values (though there may be truth-value gaps where conditionals are concerned). At the same time, I believe that we can distinguish between certain classes of conditionals on semantic grounds, in a way which does not impugn the underlying univocality of 'if. Also, I believe that many conditionals, and especially many counterfactuals, are highly context-sensitive - in the sense that what proposition is expressed by a counterfactual conditional sentence typically depends upon the context of utterance. All this I hope to explain in due course.},

Blair examines methods of information management in ancient and medieval Europe as well as the Islamic world and China, then focuses particular attention on the organization, composition, and reception of Latin reference books in print in early modern Europe. She explores in detail the sophisticated and sometimes idiosyncratic techniques that scholars and readers developed in an era of new technology and exploding information.},

This chapter discusses the historical heartland of philosophical modal logic—namely, the scope and limitations of modal logic as an account of necessity and possibility. It also examines modal logic and the logic of belief change, and modal logic as logic of action. The relationship between the logical and metaphysical interpretation of the alethic modalities is discussed. The epistemic logic and deontic logic are meant to illustrate two different uses that modal logic or indeed any logic can have: it may be applied to already existing (non-logical) theory, or it can be used to develop new theory. Modal logic is brought to bear on an area that has already reached a degree of maturity and that is formulated with little or no regard to modal logic. There is a strong connection between the theory of belief change and the logic of conditionals.},

A recent articulation of this view has been developed in terms of quantification over different cases: classical logic emerges from consistent and complete cases; constructive logic from consistent and incomplete cases, and paraconsistent logic from inconsistent and complete cases. We argue that this formulation causes pluralism to collapse into either logical nihilism or logical universalism. In its place, we propose a modalist account of logical pluralism that is independently well motivated and that avoids these collapses.},

For example, [9] shows that if ZFC is consistent, then the ZFC-provably valid principles of the class of all forcing are precisely the assertions of the modal theory S4.2. In this article, we prove similarly that the provably valid principles of collapse forcing, Cohen forcing and other classes are in each case exactly S4.3; the provably valid principles of c.c.c. forcing, proper forcing, and others are each contained within S4.3 and do not contain S4.2; the provably valid principles of countably closed forcing, CH-preserving forcing and others are each exactly S4.2; and the provably valid principles of $\omega$1-preserving forcing are contained within S4.tBA. All these results arise from general structural connections we have identified between a forcing class and the modal logic of forcing to which it gives rise.},

Moods differ fundamentally from some of our other affective states and hence require distinct explanatory tools. The computational theory of mood I propose places them within the context of other mental phenomena and is consistent with the empirical data on moods.},

abstract = {Dynamic Epistemic Logic is the logic of knowledge change. This is not about one logical system, but about a whole family of logics that allows us to specify static and dynamic aspects of multi-agent systems. This book provides various logics to support such formal specifications, including proof systems. Concrete examples and epistemic puzzles enliven the exposition. The book also contains exercises including answers and is eminently suitable for graduate courses in logic. A sweeping chapter-wise outline of the content of this book is the following. The chapter 'Introduction' informs the reader about the history of the subject, and its relation to other disciplines. 'Epistemic Logic' is an overview of multi-agent epistemic logic - the logic of knowledge - including modal operators for groups, such as general and common knowledge. 'Belief Revision' is an overview on how to model belief revision, both in the 'traditional' way and in a dynamic epistemic setting. 'Public Announcements' is a detailed and comprehensive introduction to the logic of knowledge to which dynamic operators for truthful public announcement are added. Many interesting applications are also presented in this chapter: a form of cryptography for ideal agents also known as 'the Russian cards problem', the sum-and-product riddle, etc. 'Epistemic Actions' introduces a generalization of public announcement logic to more complex epistemic actions. A different perspective on that matter is independently presented in 'Action Models'. 'Completeness' gives details on the completeness proof for the logics introduced in 'Epistemic Logic', 'Public Announcements', and 'Action Models'. 'Expressivity' discusses various results on the expressive power of the logics presented.},

abstract = {Michael Dummett's new book is the greatly expanded and recently revised version of his distinguished William James Lectures, delivered in 1976. Dummett regards the construction of a satisfactory theory of meaning as the most pressing task of contemporary analytical philosophy. He believes that the successful completion of this difficult assignment will lead to a resolution of problems before which philosophy has been stalled, in some instances for centuries. These problems turn on the correctness or incorrectness of a realistic view of one or another realm--the physical world, the mind, the past, mathematical reality, and so forth. Rejection of realism amounts to adoption of a variant semantics, and often of a variant logic, for the statements in a certain sector of our language. Dummett does not assume the correctness of any one logical system but shows how the choice between different logics arises at the level of the theory of meaning and depends upon the choice of one or another general form of meaning-theory. In order to determine the correct shape for a meaning-theory, we must attain a clear conception of what a meaning-theory can be expected to do. Such a conception, says Dummett, will form "a base camp for an assault on the metaphysical peaks: I have no greater ambition in this book than to set up a base camp."},

abstract = {Three different concepts of matter are identified: matter as what a thing is immediately made of, matter as stuff of a certain kind, and matter in the (dubious) sense of material ‘substratum'. The doctrine of hylomorphism, which regards every individual concrete thing as being ‘combination' of matter and form, is chal- lenged. Instead it is urged that we do well to identify an individual concrete thing with its own particular ‘substantial form'. The notions of form and matter, far from being correlative, are relatively independent. There is nothing absurd in the notion of form without matter. Matter provides neither a principle of individuation nor a criterion of identity for individual concrete things: their form alone provides both. Finally, a substance ontology which admits also the existence of particular qualities, or tropes, is to be preferred both to a substance ontology which denies the existence of tropes and to a pure trope ontology.},

@book{Patterson2010,
abstract = {New Essays on Tarski and Philosophy aims to show the way to a proper understanding of the philosophical legacy of the great logician, mathematician, and philosopher Alfred Tarski (1902-1983). The contributors are an international group of scholars, some expert in the historical background and context of Tarski's work, others specializing in aspects of his philosophical development, others more interested in understanding Tarski in the light of contemporary thought.The essays can be seen as addressing Tarski's seminal treatment of four basic questions about logical consequence. (1) How are we to understand truth, one of the notions in terms of which logical consequence is explained? What is it that is preserved in valid inference, or that such inference allows us to discover new claims to have on the basis of old? (2) Among what kinds of things does the relation of logical consequence hold? (3) Given answers to the first two questions, what isinvolved in the consequence relationship itself? What is the preservation at work in 'truth preservation'? (4) Finally, what do truth and consequence so construed have to do with meaning?},

@article{Kment2014,
abstract = {Since the groundbreaking work of Saul Kripke, David Lewis, and others in the 1960s and 1970s, one dominant interest of analytic philosophers has been in modal truths, which concern the question of what is possible and what is necessary. However, there is considerable controversy over the source and nature of necessity. This book takes a novel approach to the study of modality that places special emphasis on understanding the origin of modal notions in everyday thought. This book argues that the concepts of necessity and possibility originate in a common type of thought experiment—counterfactual reasoning—that allows us to investigate explanatory connections. This cognitive routine is closely related to the controlled experiments of empirical science. Necessity is defined in terms of causation and other forms of explanation such as grounding, the relation that connects metaphysically fundamental facts to non-fundamental ones. Therefore, contrary to a widespread view, explanation is more fundamental than modality. The study of modal facts is important for philosophy, not because these facts are of much metaphysical interest in their own right, but because they provide evidence about explanatory relationships. In the course of developing this position, the book offers new accounts of possible and impossible worlds, counterfactual conditionals, essential truths and their role in grounding, and a novel theory of how counterfactuals relate to causation and explanation.},

@phdthesis{Simpson1994,
abstract = {Possible world semantics underlies many of the applications of modal logic in computer science and philosophy. The standard theory arises from interpreting the semantic definitions in the ordinary meta-theory of informal classical mathematics. If, however, the same semantic definitions are interpreted in an intuitionistic meta-theory then the induced modal logics no longer satisfy certain intuitionistically invalid principles. This thesis investigates the intuitionistic modal logics that arise in this way. Natural deduction systems for various intuitionistic modal logics are presented. From one point of view, these systems are self-justifying in that a possible world interpretation of the modalities can be read off directly from the inference rules. A technical justification is given by the faithfulness of translations into intuitionistic first-order logic. It is also established that, in many cases, the natural deduction systems induce well-known intuitionistic modal logics, previously given by Hilbert-style axiomatizations. The main benefit of the natural deduction systems over axiomatizations is their susceptibility to proof-theoretic techniques. Strong normalization (and confluence) results are proved for all of the systems. Normalization is then used to establish the completeness of cut-free sequent calculi for all of the systems, and decidability for some of the systems. Lastly, techniques developed throughout the thesis are used to establish that those intuitionistic modal logics proved decidable also satisfy the finite model property. For the logics considered, decidability and the finite model property presented open problems.},

abstract = {We address an argument by Floridi (Synthese 168(1):151–178, 2009; 2011a), to the effect that digital and analogue are not features of reality, only of modes of presentation of reality. One can therefore have an informational ontology, like Floridi's Informational Structural Realism, without commitment to a supposedly digital or analogue world. After introducing the topic in Sect. 1, in Sect. 2 we explain what the proposition expressed by the title of our paper means. In Sect. 3, we describe Floridi's argument. In the following three sections, we raise three difficulties for it, (i) an objection from intuitions: Floridi's view is not supported by the intuitions embedded in the scientific views he exploits (Sect. 4); (ii) an objection from mereology: the view is incompatible with the world's having parts (Sect. 5); (iii) an objection from counting: the view entails that the question of how many things there are doesn't make sense (Sect. 6). In Sect. 7, we outline two possible ways out for Floridi's position. Such ways out involve tampering with the logical properties of identity, and this may be bothersome enough. Thus, Floridi's modus ponens will be our (and most ontologists') modus tollens. {\textcopyright} 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

@article{Gabbay2003,
abstract = {1st ed. Modal logics, originally conceived in philosophy, have recently found many applications in computer science, artificial intelligence, the foundations of mathematics, linguistics and other disciplines. Celebrated for their good computational behaviour, modal logics are used as effective formalisms for talking about time, space, knowledge, beliefs, actions, obligations, provability, etc. However, the nice computational properties can drastically change if we combine some of these formalisms into a many-dimensional system, say, to reason about knowledge bases developing in time or moving objects. To study the computational behaviour of many-dimensional modal logics is the main aim of this book. On the one hand, it is concerned with providing a solid mathematical foundation for this discipline, while on the other hand, it shows that many seemingly different applied many-dimensional systems (e.g., multi-agent systems, description logics with epistemic, temporal and dynamic operators, spatio-temporal logics, etc.) fit in perfectly with this theoretical framework, and so their computational behaviour can be analyzed using the developed machinery. We start with concrete examples of applied one- and many-dimensional modal logics such as temporal, epistemic, dynamic, description, spatial logics, and various combinations of these. Then we develop a mathematical theory for handling a spectrum of 'abstract' combinations of modal logics - fusions and products of modal logics, fragments of first-order modal and temporal logics - focusing on three major problems: decidability, axiomatizability, and computational complexity. Besides the standard methods of modal logic, the technical toolkit includes the method of quasimodels, mosaics, tilings, reductions to monadic second-order logic, algebraic logic techniques. Finally, we apply the developed machinery and obtained results to three case studies from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning: temporal epistemic logics for reasoning about multi-agent systems, modalized description logics for dynamic ontologies, and spatio-temporal logics. The genre of the book can be defined as a research monograph. It brings the reader to the front line of current research in the field by showing both recent achievements and directions of future investigations (in particular, multiple open problems). On the other hand, well-known results from modal and first-order logic are formulated without proofs and supplied with references to accessible sources. The intended audience of this book is logicians as well as those researchers who use logic in computer science and artificial intelligence. More specific application areas are, e.g., knowledge representation and reasoning, in particular, terminological, temporal and spatial reasoning, or reasoning about agents. And we also believe that researchers from certain other disciplines, say, temporal and spatial databases or geographical information systems, will benefit from this book as well.

abstract = {It is controversial whether the adult early visual cortex is sufficiently plastic to cause visual perceptual learning (VPL). The controversy occurs partially because most VPL studies have examined correlations between behavioral and neural activity changes rather than cause-and-effect relationships. Using an online-feedback method that utilizes decoded functional magnetic resonance imaging signals, we induced activity patterns only in early visual cortex corresponding to an orientation without stimulus presentation or subjects' awareness of what was to be learned. The induced activation caused VPL specific to the orientation. These results suggest that early visual areas are so plastic that mere inductions of activity patterns are sufficient to cause VPL. This technique can induce plasticity in a highly selective manner, potentially leading to powerful training and rehabilitative protocols.},

Simon Critchley argues that poetry enlarges life with a range of observation, power of expression and attention to language that eclipses any other medium. In a rich engagement with the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Critchley reveals that poetry also contains deep and important philosophical insight. Above all, he agues for a 'poetic epistemology' that enables us to think afresh the philosophical problem of the relation between mind and world, and ultimately to cast the problem away. Drawing astutely on Kant, the German and English Romantics and Heidegger, Critchley argues that through its descriptions of particular things and their stubborn plainness - whether water, guitars, trees, or cats - poetry evokes the 'mereness' of things. It is this experience, he shows, that provokes the mood of calm and releases the imaginative insight we need to press back against the pressure of reality. Critchley also argues that this calm defines the cinematic eye of Terrence Malick, whose work is discussed at the end of the book.},

abstract = {Wallace Stevens is one of the major poets of the twentieth century, and also among the most challenging. His poems can be dazzling in their verbal brilliance. They are often shot through with lavish imagery and wit, informed by a lawyer's logic, and disarmingly unexpected: a singing jackrabbit, the seductive Nanzia Nunzio. They also spoke--and still speak--to contemporary concerns. Though his work is popular and his readership continues to grow, many readers encountering it are baffled by such rich and strange poetry.  Eleanor Cook, a leading critic of poetry and expert on Stevens, gives us here the essential reader's guide to this important American poet. Cook goes through each of Stevens's poems in his six major collections as well as his later lyrics, in chronological order. For each poem she provides an introductory head note and a series of annotations on difficult phrases and references, illuminating for us just why and how Stevens was a master at his art. Her annotations, which include both previously unpublished scholarship and interpretive remarks, will benefit beginners and specialists alike. Cook also provides a brief biography of Stevens, and offers a detailed appendix on how to read modern poetry.  A Reader's Guide to Wallace Stevens is an indispensable resource and the perfect companion to The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens, first published in 1954 in honor of Stevens's seventy-fifth birthday, as well as to the 1997 collection Wallace Stevens: Collected Poetry and Prose.},

Bueno advances four related theses in order to ground such a claim: 1) identity is presupposed in every conceptual system; 2) identity is required to characterize an individual; 3) identity cannot be defined; 4) the intelligibility of quantification requires identity. We address each of these points and argue that there are no compelling reasons to hold that identity is fundamental in these cases. So, in the end, identity may not be a fundamental concept after all.},

abstract = {Identity is arguably one of the most fundamental concepts in metaphysics. There are several reasons why this is the case: (a) Identity is presupposed in every conceptual system: without identity, it is unclear that any conceptual system can be formulated. (b) Identity is required to characterize an individual: nothing can be an individual unless it has well-specified identity conditions. (c) Identity cannot be defined: even in systems that allegedly have the resources to define identity. (d) Identity is required for quantification: the intelligibility of quantification presupposes the identity of the objects that are quantified over. These are only four considerations in support of identity's fundamental role. In this paper, I examine and defend them. I then examine a challenge that has been raised against identity's fundamentality: one from the metaphysics of physics—based on a significant interpretation of non-relativist quantum mechanics—according to which certain quantum particles lack identity conditions. After responding to this challenge, I consider the nature of the commitment to identity, and argue that it turns out to be very minimal. In fact, a very deflationary form of metaphysics can accommodate it. In arguing that identity is fundamental, one need not overstep the boundaries of even a very minimal empiricist metaphysics. Or so I argue.},

abstract = {Modal formulae express monadic second-order properties on Kripke frames, but in many important cases these have first-order equivalents. Computing such equivalents is important for both logical and computational reasons. On the other hand, canonicity of modal formulae is important, too, because it implies frame-completeness of logics axiomatized with canonical formulae. Computing a first-order equivalent of a modal formula amounts to elimination of secondorder quantifiers. Two algorithms have been developed for second-order quantifier elimination: SCAN, based on constraint resolution, and DLS, based on a logical equivalence established by Ackermann. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, SQEMA, for computing first-order equivalents (using a modal version of Ackermann's lemma) and, moreover, for proving canonicity of modal formulae. Unlike SCAN and DLS, it works directly on modal formulae, thus avoiding Skolemization and the subsequent problem of unskolemization. We present the core algorithm and illustrate it with some examples. We then prove its correctness and the canonicity of all formulae on which the algorithm succeeds. We show that it succeeds not only on all Sahlqvist formulae, but also on the larger class of inductive formulae, introduced in our earlier papers. Thus, we develop a purely algorithmic approach to proving canonical completeness in modal logic and, in particular, establish one of the most general completeness results in modal logic so far.},

In addition to presenting the relevant technical background, it highlights both the pitfalls and potential uses of neighborhood models – an interesting class of mathematical structures that were originally introduced to provide a semantics for weak systems of modal logic (the so-called non-normal modal logics). In addition, the book discusses a broad range of topics, including standard modal logic results (i.e., completeness, decidability and definability); bisimulations for neighborhood models and other model-theoretic constructions; comparisons with other semantics for modal logic (e.g., relational models, topological models, plausibility models); neighborhood semantics for first-order modal logic, applications in game theory (coalitional logic and game logic); applications in epistemic logic (logics of evidence and belief); and non-normal modal logics with dynamic modalities. The book can be used as the primary text for seminars on philosophical logic focused on non-normal modal logics; as a supplemental text for courses on modal logic, logic in AI, or philosophical logic (either at the undergraduate or graduate level); or as the primary source for researchers interested in learning about the uses of neighborhood semantics in philosophical logic and game theory.},

abstract = {Philosophers have long noticed the similarity of identity over time and identity across worlds. Despite this similarity, analogous views on these matters are not always taken equally seriously. Four-dimensionalism is one of the most well-known accounts of identity over time. There is a clear modal analogue of four-dimensionalism, on which objects are modally extended and their trans-world identity is a matter of having distinct modal parts located in different possible worlds. Yet this view, which we might call 'five-dimensionalism,' is rarely discussed or defended, in compari-son to its temporal counterpart. I argue that five-dimensionalism is at least as plausible as four-dimensionalism and deserves serious consideration as an account of trans-world identity. The strategy is to show that arguments typically used in defence of four-dimensionalism can be adapted to defend five-dimensionalism as well. A powerful consideration in favour of four-dimensionalism is the fact that it provides an elegant and unified solution to a variety of puzzles concerning material coincidence. I show that such puzzles come in equally troubling modal varieties and that five-dimensionalism provides an equally unified and elegant solution to them. 1 Philosophers have long noticed the similarity of identity over time and identity across worlds. Despite this similarity, analogous views on these matters are not always taken equally seriously. Four-dimensionalism (the view that objects persist through time by having temporal parts located at different times) remains one of the most well-known and widely held views of identity over time. 2},

abstract = {Mereotopology is a theory of connected parts. The existence of boundaries, as parts of everyday objects, is basic to any such theory; but in classical mereotopology, there is a problem: if boundaries exist, then either distinct entities cannot be in contact, or else space is not topologically connected (Varzi in No{\^{u}}s 31:26–58, 1997). In this paper we urge that this problem can be met with a paraconsistent mereotopology, and sketch the details of one such approach. The resulting theory focuses attention on the role of empty parts, in delivering a balanced and bounded metaphysics of naive space.},

It can be found in con-temporary epistemology and ethics, and has even made its way into linguistics and decision the-ory. What are those possible worlds, the entities to which theorists in these disciplines all appeal? Some have hoped that a theory of possible worlds can be used to reduce modality to non-modal terms. This paper sets reductive theories aside, and articulates and applies a framework for evaluat-ing non-reductive theories of possible worlds. I argue that, if we abjure reduction, we should aim for a theory of possible worlds that is user-friendly. I then outline four leading contemporary the-ories and consider objections to each. My conclusions are negative: every theory we discuss fails to be user-friendly in some significant respect. In another review, I noted the spread of possible worlds as a tool for theorizing to fields far removed from the metaphysics of modality, including epistemology, ethics, linguistics and decision theory. I noted there that theorists in those other areas rely on: (SC) it is possible that / iff there is a w such that w is a possible world and '/' is true at w. I briefly discussed a view (see Lewis 1986) which attempts to use (SC) to provide a the-ory of possible worlds aimed at using (SC) to reduce modality. 1 This review sets aside such reductive theories of possible worlds, and concentrates instead on four leading non-reductive theories. Although some of these theories have reductive variants, the versions that figure most prominently in contemporary discussions disavow any ambition to reduce modality to non-modal terms. I start by considering what theoretical purposes other than reduction possible worlds might serve (Section 1). I will then turn to the consideration of the four leading views (Sections 2–5).},

@article{Miller2001a,
abstract = {This paper is a survey of current work in the metaphysics of possibility. Rather than feigning neutrality, which critical readers would not believe, I prefer to make my point of view clear from the outset. I am a Modal Realist, who was written in defense of the reality of possible worlds in the past. In this paper I continue to argue for a version of that position in the course of my survey of the literature. Whereas the problems with Linguistic Ersatzism and Fictionalism are deep and insoluble, the main flaw of Modal Realism, its ontological extravagance, can be completely eliminated without any loss of explanatory power. Before preceding to my arguments there are two features of the continuing debate over the reality of possible worlds to which I would like to draw the reader's attention. The first is its personalized character. Other theories of modality are seen as options available to all, but Modal Realism is identified with David Lewis. When a philosopher of Lewis' stature propounds a theory and he is the only significant philosopher who defends it, it is natural that other philosophers will think of it as his theory {\~{}}. This tendency should be resisted however. To look at a philosophical position through the lens of a single mind, no matter how brilliant, gives a distorted picture. Lewis has highly articulated and well argued views on a host of metaphysical issues from nominalism to personal identity. As valuable as it is, the very power of his philosophical vision makes it harder to see Modal Realism as a way of understanding possibility consistent with a whole spectrum of metaphysical positions. How would Modal Realism look if developed by philosophers who disagreed with Lewis about nominalism, personal identity, minds, reductionism, or materialism? Such interesting and potentially fruitful questions go unasked when we persist in thinking of Modal Realism as the idiosyncrasy of one brilliant mind. Modal Realism is provocative in its ontological extravagance. This, the second feature of the debate to which I draw attention, has surely not gone unnoticed, but its connection to the first has. In this paper I propose to examine Modal Realism as an option for dealing with possibility that is compatible with a wide range of views on other issues in metaphysics. I will show how the ontological extravagance of Modal Realism varies with the specific form it takes. Moreover, I will trace the ontological extravagance in Lewis's position to what I consider an inessential quirk --his extending Modal Realism to the outer realm of possibility. In conclusion I will excise the quirk showing how its job can be done more economically by other means and so propose a downsized Modal Realism as modest as any Actualism.},

 standing as far as we can the fundamental structure of reality as a whole. Accordingly, it is urged, the deliverances of formal ontology have a modal and epistemic status akin to those of other a priori sciences, such as mathematics and logic, rather than
 constituting rivals to the claims of the empirical sciences, such as physics.

abstract = { ABSTRACT Kant's claim that modality is a 'category' provides an approach to modality to be contrasted with Lewis's reductive analysis. Lewis's position is
 unsatisfactory, since it depends on an inherently modal conception of a world. This suggests that modality is 'primitive'; and the Kantian position is a prima facie plausible position of this kind, which is filled out by considering the relationship between modality and inference. This provides a context for comparing the Kantian position with Wright's non-cognitivist 'conventionalism'. Wright's position is vulnerable to the type of argument used against ethical non-cognitivism, and the Kantian position is further confirmed by Blackburn's acknowledgment that modality is 'antinaturalistic to its core'. The position is
 further elaborated to show that it can accommodate the famous Kripkean categories of the empirically necessary and the contingent a priori, and finally
 defended against the criticisms used by Quine against Carnap.},

@article{Berto2011,
abstract = {We outline a neo-Meinongian framework labeled as Modal Meinongian Metaphysics (MMM) to account for the ontology and semantics of fictional discourse. Several competing accounts of fictional objects are originated by the fact that our talking of them mirrors incoherent intuitions: mainstream theories of fiction privilege some such intuitions, but are forced to account for others via complicated paraphrases of the relevant sentences. An ideal theory should resort to as few paraphrases as possible. In Sect. 1, we make this explicit via two methodological principles, called the Minimal Revision and the Acceptability Constraint. In Sect. 2, we introduce the standard distinction between internal and external fictional discourse. In Sects. 3-5, we discuss the approaches of (traditional) Meinongianism, Fictionalism, and Realism - and their main troubles. In Sect. 6 we propose our MMM approach. This is based upon (1) a modal semantics including impossible worlds (Subsect. 6.1); (2) a qualified Comprehension Principle for objects (Subsect. 6.2); (3) a notion of ex istence-entailment for properties (Subsect. 6.3). In Sect. 7 we present a formal semantics for MMM based upon a representation operator. And in Sect. 8 we have a look at how MMM solves the problems of the three aforementioned theories.},

For instance, in his 'Advice on Modal Logic' Dana Scott recommends to modal logicians a sandwich universe consisting of actual, potential, and virtual individuals. The important domain D is the one which contains actual and potential but no virtual individuals. Of this class Scott writes: "I feel it is important to be thinking of D as fixed in advance" (his italics). According to Scott, we can quantify over D. What is there to be said of this revival of possible individuals? It seems to me that it is not immune to challenges of the same type as Quine's and that it contains dangerous oversimplifications. There may be a sense in which the idea of possible individual can, and should, be restored to honor. Be this as it may, I am not convinced that the domain of possible individuals is anything we can start from in the sense of take for granted, at least not in some of the most important philosophical applications of modal logic. I am not sure, either, that all the possible individuals we in some sense have to deal with can eventually be pooled into one big happy domain.

A family of paradoxes akin to the set-theoretic antinomies seem to allow one to derive a contradiction from apparently plausible principles. Some of them concern the interaction between propositions and worlds, and they appear to afford the means to map classes of propositions into propositions – or, likewise, classes of worlds into worlds – in a one-to-one fashion that leads to contradiction. Yet another family of paradoxes threaten the view that whatever could exist does, in fact, exist, which is in line with modal realism, for example.

@article{Nolan2013,
abstract = {Philosophers have found postulating possible worlds to be very useful in a number of areas, including philosophy of language and mind, logic, and metaphysics. Impossible worlds are a natural extension to this use of possible worlds, and can help resolve a number of difficulties thrown up by possible-worlds frameworks. Philosophers spend a lot of time thinking about what is possible or necessary, as well as about what is in fact the case. Many philosophers doing metaphysics are interested in what features of our world are metaphysically necessary, and what are mere contingencies. Logicians are interested in what arguments are necessarily truth preserving, not just in what arguments happen to have all true premises and a true conclusion. Moral and political philosophers spend a lot of time considering hypothetical scenarios or societal arrangements. Possibility and necessity seem important to philosophers, and this is one reason why talk about modality (possibility and necessity) has played an important role in many philosophical debates in the last half-century. There has been a widespread use of possible worlds in philosophical discussions. But what lies beyond the possible? Is there a realm of impossibility, and impossible worlds? On the face of it, we appear to be able to describe impossible situations, and moreover to produce a range of different scenarios that we take to be completely impossible. We do this for a number of reasons. Impossible circumstances are the subject of stories and other artwork, like the drawings of impossibilities by M.C. Escher or fictions like some of Jorge Luis Borges's short stories. Another less high-brow kind of example of impossible fictions can arguably be found in many time-travel stories and films: even if time travel of some sort is possible, genuine time travel arguably cannot work as it was portrayed in the Back to the Future movies. Description of impossible scenarios seems to serve more theoretical purposes as well. Sometimes impossible scenarios are described intentionally, but sometimes people end up dealing with impossibilities despite intending to only describe possibilities. Many claims of interest to philosophers seem to be necessary if true, and impossible if false. Central metaphysical claims about the nature of the world are often supposed to have this feature, such as ''analyses'' of causation, or hypotheses about the nature of laws of nature, or claims about the metaphysics of possible worlds; philosophers who offer analyses of knowledge or meaning or free will often take themselves to be establishing conceptual truths that would be absolutely necessary; and the fundamental principles of ethics are often supposed to be like this too, just to take three kinds of examples. When subject matters like this are under dispute, chances are that one or more parties to a disagreement believe a theory of the world that is, unbeknownst to them, entirely impossible. Despite the impossibility of many false philosophical positions, those positions seem to be understandable, and the sorts of things we can have rational disagreements about.

The striking success of possible-worlds semantics in modal logic has made this ontological doctrine attractive. Modal realists maintain that philosophers must accept the existence of possible worlds if they wish to have the benefit of using possible-worlds semantics to assess modal arguments and explain modal principles. The book challenges this claim, and argues instead for modality without worlds; it offers a new account of the role of interpretations or structures of the formal languages of logic.},

Hartry Field argues that we can explain the utility of mathematics without assuming it true. Part of the argument is that good mathematics has a special feature ("conservativeness") that allows it to be applied to "nominalistic" claims (roughly, those neutral to the existence of mathematical entities) in a way that generates nominalistic consequences more easily without generating any new ones. Field goes on to argue that we can axiomatize physical theories using nominalistic claims only, and that in fact this has advantages over the usual axiomatizations that are independent of nominalism. There has been much debate about the book since it first appeared. It is now reissued in a revised contains a substantial new preface giving the author's current views on the original book and the issues that were raised in the subsequent discussion of it.},

He has two arguments for this thesis, what I shall call 'the Parallel-Case Argument' and 'the Theoretical-Benefits Argument'. A central issue in the metaphysics of modality is whether Yagisawa's thesis is right. Few philosophers have been (or will be) able to face impossibilia with much courage; most already reject Lewisian modal realism. But if Yagisawa is right, not only would Lewis's critics have further reason to reject his modal realism - its ontology is even crazier than they thought - but (more importantly) Lewis himself, insofar as he unequivocally rejects genuine impossible worlds and their inhabitants, would have good reason to think that whatever benefits of modal realism there may be just aren't worth its ontological cost after all. My aim in this paper is to reject Yagisawa's thesis by rebutting his two arguments in support.},

abstract = {The chapters in the present volume go beyond 'classical' extensional logic with respect to one important factor: they all include among the semantic constituents representations of so-called 'possible worlds'. The inclusion of such 'indices' has turned out to be the semantic mainstay in dealing with a number of issues having to do with intensional features of natural and artificial languages. It is, of course, an open question whether 'possible world' semantics is in the final analysis the proper solution to the many problems and puzzles intensional constructions raise for the logical analysis of the many varieties of discourse. At present, there seem to be about as many opponents as proponents with regard to the usefulness of having the semantics of intensional languages based on possible world constructs. Some attempts to come to grips with intensional phenomena which are not couched in the possible world framework are discussed in Volume IV of the Handbook. Chapter 1 is an extensive survey of the main systems of (propositional) modal logic including the most important meta-mathematical results and the techniques used in establishing these. It introduces the basic terminology and semantic machinery applied in one way or another in many of the subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 discusses the most significant developments in (propositional) tense logic which can of course be regarded as a special kind of modal logic, where the possible world indices are simply (ordered) moments of time.

To propose the idea of a possible world that differs in some way from our actual world - for example a world where the grass is red or where no people exist - can help us to analyse and understand a wide range of philosophical concepts, such as counterfactuals, properties, modality, and of course, the notions of possibility and necessity. This book examines the ways in which possible worlds have been used as a framework for considering problems in logic and argument analysis. The book begins with a non-technical introduction to the basic ideas of modal logic in terms of Kripke's possible worlds and then moves on to a discussion of 'possible for' and 'possible that'. The central chapters examine questions of meaning, epistemic possibility, temporal logic, metaphysics, and impossibility. Girle also investigates how the idea of a possible world can be put to use in different areas of philosophy, the problems it may raise, and the benefits that can be gained.},

It is argued that such a view combines some of the more attractive aspects of the Carnapian and Quinean approaches to logic, whilst avoiding some famous problems.},

Still, it isn't clear to us that David Lewis argues for it in the wrong way. “The hypothesis is serviceable,” he says, “and that is a reason to think that it is true” (1986, p. 3). Let's grant him the ﬁrst claim: MR is serviceable, which is to say that it allows us “to reduce the diversity of notions we must accept as primitive, and thereby to improve the unity and economy of the theory that is our professional concern – total theory, the whole of what we take to be true” (1986, p. 4). Our interest here is in the second claim, the thesis to the effect that a hypothesis's being serviceable can provide reason to believe it. A number of philosophers maintain that this latter is false; others insist that it's of no help to Lewis. So on one basis or the other, they conclude that Lewis' argument for MR doesn't get off the ground.1 We disagree. Our aim here is to show that there isn't a cogent objection to Lewis' use of serviceability that doesn't rely a premise that he is justiﬁed in rejecting.},

abstract = {In this thesis, the modal realist metaphysics of modality of David Lewis is subjected to a Kantian critique. Modal realism is the theory that possible worlds are the sorts of things our actual world is. Lewis's argument for modal realism in "Possible Worlds" contains what in Kantian terms are synthetic apriori propositions. Kant's answer to the question of how synthetic apriori modal propositions are possible is examined. Kant is found to have erred in choosing de dicto modal concepts and principles, given his notion of an objective transcendental deduction, an argument which shows that, without these concepts, experience of objects would not be possible. The error is corrected by supplying de re modal concepts and a new modal principle: the principle of essence and accident. I argue that the principle of essence and accident is a valid synthetic apriori modal principle. Lewis's argument for possible worlds is shown to be fallacious by pointing out that synthetic apriori principles do not imply the existence of transcendent entities. However, I put forth a "practical grounds argument"--an argument from the necessary conditions of moral practice--for "postulating" concrete possible worlds. Finally, I propose a concept of concrete possible worlds that is more compatible with Kantian principles than is Lewis's conception.},

The issue should be important to the genuine modal realist because, not only is metaphysical nihilism itself intuitively plausible, but also it is supported by an argument with pre-theoretically credible premises, namely, the subtraction argument. Given the soundness of the subtraction argument, we show that there are two ways that the genuine modal realist can accommodate metaphysical nihilism: (i) by allowing for worlds containing only spatiotemporal points and (ii) by allowing for a world containing nothing but the null individual.

One advantage claimed for this position is that it offers us the resources to analyse, in a noncircular manner, the modal operators. In this paper, we argue that the prospects for such an analysis are poor. For the analysis of necessity as truth in all worlds to succeed it is not enough that no modal concepts be used in the realist's account of a possible world (a fact we grant); rather, such an analysis will succeed only if the set of worlds that is postulated is complete. By appealing to plausible truths about the number of possible alien natural properties, we show that there are serious difficulties in guaranteeing that such a set exists without taking some modal concept as primitive.

I show that genuine modal realism, as it has thus far been explicitly developed, and in so far as it deals with advanced modal claims, cannot accommodate the principles in question. On behalf of the genuine modal realist I motivate and propose a redundancy interpretation of advanced possibility claims and extend that interpretation to the cognate cases of necessity, impossibility and contingency. I then show that the problematic principles as they apply to advanced modal claims can be derived from these interpretations. I show further how the proposed interpretation enables the genuine modal realist to deal with a number of objections that centre on the alleged inadequacy of the genuine modal realist's expressive resources. I conclude that genuine modal realism emerges the stronger for having been shown capable of dealing with advanced modal claims on the basis of no conceptual and ontological resources beyond those it requires to deal with ordinary modal claims.},

Or at least that is so if the applied theory is adequate. For an applied possible-worlds semantic theory that is constrained to contain only one-world models is bound to deliver results on validity, soundness and completeness that are apt to seem disastrous. I attempt to steer a course between commitment to the existence of a plurality of possible worlds and commitment to such a disastrous applied possible-worlds semantics by noting, and developing, the position of one who asserts such a theory at face-value but who remains agnostic about the existence of other (non-actualized) possible worlds. Thus, a novel interpretation of applied possible-worlds semantics is offered on which we may lay claim to whatever benefits such a theory offers while avoiding realism about (other) possible worlds. Thereby, the contention that applied possible-worlds semantics gives us reason to be realists about possible worlds is (further) undermined.},

abstract = {Many theories assimilate the idioms of modality to those of quantification; they hold that so-and-so is possible iff there is a "world" at which it is true that so-and-so. "Modal realism" identifies worlds with certain concrete particulars, and truth at a world with what is true of it. Rival "ersatz" theories identify worlds with certain abstract entities and identify what is true at them with what they represent. ;David Lewis argues that pre-theoretic modal intuitions are best explained by modal realism. I try to make a case for ersatzism. ;First, I argue that modal realism is flawed on the grounds that it entails the impossibility of certain intuitively possible spatiotemporal structures; it fails to explain fully even those intuitions with which it is compatible; and it renders the origin of modal knowledge mysterious. ;Next, I argue that objections to ersatzism are not conclusive. ;Lewis objects that even a generic version of ersatzism requires an unnameable and maybe unintelligible primitive relation. I suggest that the problems with naming are perfectly general; they have nothing to do with metaphysical theories of modality in particular. And I suggest a solution taken from Lewis himself. I also argue that any purported unintelligibility is due to illegitimately assimilating the relation to spatiotemporal relations. ;Finally, I consider some difficulties with a version of ersatzism that aims to reduce modality to impure set-theory. One concerns the accommodation of intuitions about properties that are not, but might have been, instantiated. Another concerns accommodation of intuitions about relations of exclusion and entailment among properties. I suggest that these difficulties are due to faulty assumptions about the nature of properties rather than any fundamental flaws in this ersatz approach. So I propose an account of properties that when incorporated into ersatzism circumvents these difficulties and allows it to claim the advantages of modal realism without its drawbacks. Unlike traditional accounts, this takes the essence of a property to consist in its role in imposing a certain classificational structure on the particulars that instantiate it, rather than in any unique and irreducible "quiddity".},

Possible worlds are required to account for the facts of modality without assuming that modality is primitive – that there are irreducibly modal facts. We argue that on one reading, Lewis's theory licenses us to assume maverick possible worlds which spread through logical space gobbling up all the rest. Because they exclude alternatives, these worlds result in contradictions, since different spread worlds are incompatible with one another. Plainly Lewis's theory must be amended to exclude these excluders. But, we maintain, this cannot be done without bringing in modal primitives.

On the three different “concretist” interpretations of ‘exist', Modal Realism looks insufficient for genuine ontological commitment. Whereas, on the “multiverse” interpretation, Modal Realism acknowledges physical possibilities only--and worse, (assuming either axiom S5 or axiom B) each possibilium ends up as a necessary physical existent.

One is material adequacy: the modal realist must provide for each candidate analysandum an analysans in the language of counterpart theory which by his lights has the same truth value as the candidate analysandum. Must the material biconditional joining these be necessarily true? This is the requirement of strict adequacy. It is not satisfied if Lewis's 1968 scheme provides the analysis. John Divers puts forward a modification, which identifies cases of ‘advanced modalizing' in which the modal operator is semantically redundant. Even with this modification modal realist analyses of statements of modal discourse will be strictly inadequate. Strict adequacy can be achieved by extending the redundancy interpretation to all de dicto modal statements. The price is the denial of de dicto contingency. But perhaps material adequacy is enough. If the modal realist has a systematic means of replacing every sentence of quantified modal logic which he considers true by a sentence of counterpart theory that he considers true, perhaps he need do no more. Still, traditionally philosophical analysis aims at strict adequacy so it is as well to know that this is a test the modal realist analysis fails unless he abandons de dicto contingency.},

Defending both the project of metaphysics and the essentialist position that metaphysical modality is conceptually and ontologically primitive, Stephen McLeod argues that the logical positivists did not succeed in banishing metaphysical modality from their own theoretical apparatus and he offers an original defence of metaphysics against their advocacy of its elimination. Seeking to assuage the sceptical worries which underlie modal anti-realism, McLeod provides an original contribution to essentialist epistemology, engaging with current debates about modality and suggesting that standard essentialist approaches to some issues in the philosophies of logic and language require revision. This book offers valuable insights to professional philosophers, postgraduates and advanced undergraduates interested in metaphysics, philosophy of logic or the history of twentieth-century analytic philosophy.},

But these results are of broad interest since they show that would-be reductionists have more formidable argumentative resources than is often thought. Lewis's reduction depends on a set of methodological commitments each of which is fairly plausible or at least currently popular, and none of which is particular to modality. The choice of which of these commitments to reject I leave to the discerning antireductionist. The essay proceeds as follows: {\S}1 discusses reduction generally and one or two relevant puzzles; {\S}2 discusses Lewis's reduction in particular; the longest section, {\S}3 replies to four objections.},

The stunned disbelief that usually accompanies the stare is a natural first reaction to a large ontology. Indeed, Lewis has been explicitly linked with Meinong, a charge that he has taken great pains to deny. However, the issue is not a simple one. "Meinongianism" is a complex set of distinctions and doctrines about existence and predication, in addition to the famously large ontology. While there are clearly non-Meinongian features of Lewis' views, it is our thesis that many of the characteristic elements of Meinongian metaphysics appear in Lewis' theory. Moreover, though Lewis rejects incomplete and inconsistent Meinongian objects, his ontology may exceed that of a Meinongian who doesn't accept his possibilia. Thus, Lewis explains the truth of "there might have been talking donkeys" by appealing to possibilia which are talking donkeys. But the Meinongian need not accept that there exist things which are talking donkeys. Indeed, we show that a Meinongian even need not accept that there are nonexistent things which are talking donkeys!},

@phdthesis{Chua2012,
abstract = {In this essay I comparatively evaluate two realist metaphysical accounts of modality: David Lewis' (1986) genuine modal realism (GMR), and neo-Aristotelian modal realism (AMR) as put forth by Alexander Pruss (2011). GMR offers a reductive analysis of modal claims of possibility and necessity in terms of claims quantifying over concrete worlds and counterparts, and is in this way committed the existence of a plurality of concrete worlds other than the actual world; AMR, on the other hand, offers an analysis of modal claims in terms of claims about the causal powers of existing objects in the actual world, and identifies these powers and powerful properties as the truthmakers for modal truths of possibility and necessity. I consider two objections to GMR; firstly, that it leads to ethical paradoxes, and secondly, that the counterparts it offers as truthmakers for modal claims are fundamentally irrelevant to the de re modal properties of objects. I argue that AMR bears a prima facie advantage over GMR by reason of its avoidance of those two objections, before evaluating two objections faced by AMR itself, namely, that its analysis is not genuinely explanatory, and secondly, that the ontology of powers fails to account for the full range of metaphysical possibility. I argue that AMR has the resources to avoid these objections, that AMR on balance is more attractive, and that therefore AMR is worthy of serious consideration by advocates of GMR.},

abstract = {Accounts of propositions as sets of possible worlds have been criticized for conflating distinct impossible propositions. In response to this problem, some have proposed to introduce impossible worlds to represent distinct impossibilities, endorsing the thesis that impossible worlds must be of the same kind; this has been called the parity thesis. I show that this thesis faces problems, and propose a hybrid account which rejects it: possible worlds are taken as concrete Lewisian worlds, and impossibilities are represented as set-theoretic constructions out of them. This hybrid account (1) distinguishes many intuitively distinct impossible propositions; (2) identifies impossible propositions with extensional constructions; (3) avoids resorting to primitive modality, at least so far as Lewisian modal realism does.},

abstract = {I start by reconsidering two familiar arguments against modal realism. The argument from epistemology relates to the issue whether we can infer the existence of concrete objects by a priori means. The argument from pragmatics purports to refute the analogy between the indispensability of possible worlds and the indispensability of unobserved entities in physical science and of numbers in mathematics. Then I present two novel objections. One focusses on the obscurity of the notion of isolation required by modal realism. The other stresses the arbitrary nature of the rules governing the behaviour of Lewisean universes. All four objections attack the reductive analysis of modality that is supposed to be the chief merit of modal realism.},

abstract = {This paper argues that scientific realism commits us to a metaphysical determination relation between the mathematical entities that are indispensible to scientific explanation and the modal structure of the empirical phenomena those entities explain. The argument presupposes that scientific realism commits us to the indispensability argument. The view  presented here is that the indispensability of mathematics commits us not only to the existence of mathematical structures and entities but to a metaphysical determination relation between those entities and the modal structure of the physical world. The no-miracles argument is the primary motivation for scientific realism. It is a presupposition of this argument that unobservable entities are explanatory only when they determine the empirical phenomena they explain. I argue that mathematical entities should also be seen as explanatory only when they determine the empirical facts they explain, namely, the modal structure of the physical world. Thus, scientific realism commits us to a metaphysical determination relation between mathematics and physical modality that has not been previously recognized. The requirement to account for the metaphysical dependence of modal physical structure on mathematics limits the class of acceptable solutions to the applicability problem that are available to the scientific realist.},

@phdthesis{Bricker1983,
abstract = {In sections 1 through 5, I develop in detail what I call the standard theory of worlds and propositions, and I discuss a number of purported objections. The theory consists of five theses. The first two theses, presented in section 1, assert that the propositions form a Boolean algebra with respect to implication, and that the algebra is complete, respectively. In section 2, I introduce the notion of logical space: it is a field of sets that represents the propositional structure and whose space consists of all and only the worlds. The next three theses, presented in sections 3, 4, and 5, respectively, guarantee the existence of logical space, and further constrain its structure. The third thesis asserts that the set of propositions true at any world is maximal consistent; the fourth thesis that any two worlds are separated by a proposition; the fifth thesis that only one proposition is false at every world. In sections 6 through 10, I turn to the problem of reduction. In sections 6 and 7, I show how the standard theory can be used to support either a reduction of worlds to propositions or a reduction of propositions to worlds. A number of proposition-based theories are developed in section 6, and compared with Adams's world-story theory. A world-based theory is developed in section?, and Stalnaker's account of the matter is discussed. Before passing judgment on the proposition based and world-based theories, I ask in sections 8 and 9 whether both worlds and propositions might be reduced to something else. In section 8, I consider reductions to linguistic entities; in section 9, reductions to unfounded sets. After rejecting the possibility of eliminating both worlds and propositions, I return in section 10 to the possibility of eliminating one in favor of the other. I conclude, somewhat tentatively, that neither worlds nor propositions should be reduced one to the other, that both worlds and propositions should be taken as basic to our ontology.},

This David Lewis has done. Lewis holds, roughly, that worlds are maximal unified regions of logical space. So far, so good. But what Lewis means by 'unification' is too narrow, I think, in two different ways. First, for Lewis, all worlds are (almost) 'globally' unified: at any world, (almost) every part is directly linked to (almost) every other part. I hold instead that some worlds are 'locally' unified: at some worlds, parts are directly linked only to "neighboring" parts. Second, for Lewis, each world is (analogically) 'spatio-temporally' unified; every world is 'spatio-temporally' isolated from every other. I hold instead: a world may be unified by nonspatio-temporal relations; every world is 'absolutely' isolated from every other. If I am right, Lewis's conception of logical space is impoverished: perfectly respectable worlds are missing.},

Para-consistent logics have a long and fruitful history, and no doubt a long and fruitful future. To give some sense of the situation, I'll spend Section 1 exploring exactly what it takes for a logic to be paraconsistent. It will emerge that there is consider-able open texture to the idea. In Section 2, I'll give some examples of techniques for developing paraconsistent logics. In Section 3, I'll discuss what seem to me to be some promising applications of certain paraconsistent logics. In fact, however, I don't think there's all that much to the concept 'paraconsistent' itself; the collection of paraconsistent logics is far too heterogenous to be very productively dealt with under a single label. Perhaps that will emerge as we go.},

The as- sumptions about the grounds of essentialist truths concerning natural kinds familiar from the Kripke-Putnam framework are now considered questionable. The source of the problem, however, has not been sufficiently explicated. The paper focuses on the Twin Earth scenario, and it will be demonstrated that the essentialist principle at its core (which I call IDENT)—that necessarily, a sample of a chemical substance, A, is of the same kind as another sample, B, if and only if A and B have the same microstructure—must be re-evaluated. The Twin Earth scenario also assumes the falsity of another essentialist principle (which I call INST): necessarily, there is a 1:1 correlation between (all of ) the chemical properties of a chemical substance and the microstructure of that substance. This assumption will be questioned, and it will be argued that, in fact, the best strategy for defending IDENT is to establish INST. The prospects for Natural Kind Essentialism and microstructural essentialism regarding chemical substances will be assessed with reference to recent work in the philosophy of chemistry. Finally, a weakened form of INST will be presented.},

A worlds-based story may also provide the best semantics for counterfactuals. But to function well, all these accounts need use of impossible and as well as possible worlds. So what are impossible worlds? Graham Priest claims that any of the usual stories about possible worlds can be told about impossible worlds, too. But far from it. I'll argue that impossible worlds cannot be genuine worlds, of the kind proposed by Lewis, McDaniel or Yagisawa. Nor can they be ersatz worlds on the model proposed by Melia or Sider.

Packed with examples and practical problems based on stories from everyday life, this is the first textbook to explain the principles of epistemic game theory. Each chapter is dedicated to one particular, natural way of reasoning. The book then shows how each of these ways of reasoning will affect the final choices that can rationally be made and how these choices can be found by iterative procedures.

It was, he thought, the core of a new view of nature which he dubbed the "Theory of the Absolute World." This essay will focus on two related questions: how did Minkowski arrive at his idea of space time, and how did he progress from space-time to his new concept of physical reality.1 Minkowski was born on 22 June 1864 in Alexotas, Russia. In 1872 his family emigrated to Prussia, where Minkowski attended the Altst?dtisches Gymnasium in K?nigsberg. Like all students of the Gymnasium he received a strict education which stressed both classi cal literature and science. Minkowski graduated early and went on to the University of K?nigsberg, where he studied principally with Wilhelm Weber and Woldemar Voigt. He then spent three semesters in Bonn, returning to K?nigsberg to receive his doctorate in 1885.

We provide axioms that allow us to construct ‘time as formal intuition' as a pair of continua, corresponding to time as ‘inner sense' and the external representation of time as a line Both continua are replete with infinitesimals, which we use to elucidate an enigmatic discussion of ‘rest' in the Metaphysical foundations of natural science.

Temporal parts, then, are parts that are temporally smaller. My current temporal part, "me-today", we might call it, is temporally smaller than me, since it exists today and only today.

He argues that our minds organize the information involved in communicative acts in a format that can be modeled in geometric or topological terms—in what he terms conceptual spaces, extending the theory he presented in an earlier book by that name.

Many semantic theories consider the meanings of words as relatively stable and independent of the communicative context. G{\"{a}}rdenfors focuses instead on how various forms of communication establish a system of meanings that becomes shared between interlocutors. He argues that these “meetings of mind” depend on the underlying geometric structures, and that these structures facilitate language learning. Turning to lexical semantics, G{\"{a}}rdenfors argues that a unified theory of word meaning can be developed by using conceptual spaces. He shows that the meaning of different word classes can be given a cognitive grounding, and offers semantic analyses of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and prepositions. He also presents models of how the meanings of words are composed to form new meanings and of the basic semantic role of sentences. Finally, he considers the future implications of his theory for robot semantics and the Semantic Web.},

abstract = {Within cognitive science, two approaches currently dominate the problem of modeling representations. The symbolic approach views cognition as computation involving symbolic manipulation. Connectionism, a special case of associationism, models associations using artificial neuron networks. Peter G{\"{a}}rdenfors offers his theory of conceptual representations as a bridge between the symbolic and connectionist approaches.

Symbolic representation is particularly weak at modeling concept learning, which is paramount for understanding many cognitive phenomena. Concept learning is closely tied to the notion of similarity, which is also poorly served by the symbolic approach. G{\"{a}}rdenfors's theory of conceptual spaces presents a framework for representing information on the conceptual level. A conceptual space is built up from geometrical structures based on a number of quality dimensions. The main applications of the theory are on the constructive side of cognitive science: as a constructive model the theory can be applied to the development of artificial systems capable of solving cognitive tasks. G{\"{a}}rdenfors also shows how conceptual spaces can serve as an explanatory framework for a number of empirical theories, in particular those concerning concept formation, induction, and semantics. His aim is to present a coherent research program that can be used as a basis for more detailed investigations.},

Al­ though it would be hazardous to claim that the creation of significant examples is less demanding than the development of theory, we have dis­ covered that focusing on examples is a particularly expeditious means of involving undergraduate mathematics students in actual research. Not only are examples more concrete than theorems-and thus more accessible-but they cut across individual theories and make it both appropriate and neces­ sary for the student to explore the entire literature in journals as well as texts. Indeed, much of the content of this book was first outlined by under­ graduate research teams working with the authors at Saint Olaf College during the summers of 1967 and 1968. In compiling and editing material for this book, both the authors and their undergraduate assistants realized a substantial increment in topologi­ cal insight as a direct result of chasing through details of each example. We hope our readers will have a similar experience. Each of the 143 examples in this book provides innumerable concrete illustrations of definitions, theo­ rems, and general methods of proof. There is no better way, for instance, to learn what the definition of metacompactness really means than to try to prove that Niemytzki's tangent disc topology is not metacompact.

@article{Belnap2011,
abstract = {Earlier (collaborative) work postulated that agency is essentially indeterministic, and finds a home in “branching times” (BT). BT is built on world-wide but momentary events called “moments” structured by an indeterministic causal ordering. The notion of a “history” is defined as a suitable chain of moments; histories branch one from another at moments. Other earlier work, the essential points of which are summarized in Section 2, led to “branching space–times” (BST). BT moments are replaced in BST by local “point events,” and “histories” are redefined more realistically as a family of suitable space–time-like structures that branch from one another at point events. In BST one finds that “transitions” from initial events to outcome events—each properly defined—play a fundamental role as originating causes (causae causantes) and effects. This spatio-temporal-causal story provides, in Section 3, an objective foundation for an indeterministic theory of agents and choices amid BST (BSTAC), the key concepts of which are “life event,” “life history,” and “person,” the latter essentially involving alternate possibilities, some of which arise from free choices. Section 4 works out a concept of “choice point,” leading to a BST account of “agent $\alpha$ sees to outcome O,” which is more sophisticated than the stit concept of earlier work. Many-agent cooperation is considered in Section 5, with hints concerning message sending and receiving. A theory of norms in BST (BSTACN) that builds on the foregoing, and also on earlier work, is briefly adumbrated in Section 6.},

@book{Keefe1997,
abstract = {Vagueness is currently the subject of vigorous debate in the philosophy of logic and language. Vague terms—such as 'tall', 'red', 'bald', and 'tadpole'—have borderline cases (arguably, someone may be neither tall nor not tall); and they lack well-defined extensions (there is no sharp boundary between tall people and the rest). The phenomenon of vagueness poses a fundamental challenge to classical logic and semantics, which assumes that propositions are either true or false and that extensions are determinate.This anthology collects for the first time the most important papers in the field. After a substantial introduction that surveys the field, the essays form four groups, starting with some historically notable pieces. The 1970s saw an explosion of interest in vagueness, and the second group of essays reprints classic papers from this period. The following group of papers represent the best recent work on the logic and semantics of vagueness. The essays in the final group are contributions to the continuing debate about vague objects and vague identity.},

abstract = {There is currently an explosion of interest in grounding. In this article we provide an overview of the debate so far. We begin by introducing the concept of grounding, before discussing several kinds of scepticism about the topic. We then identify a range of central questions in the theory of grounding and discuss competing answers to them that have emerged in the debate. We close by raising some questions that have been relatively neglected but which warrant further attention.},

The self interest theory inspires self-interest; we expect the worst of others and act accordingly. But Frank shows, with many eloquent examples taken from a whole range of human behavior, that pure self interest leads to disaster, for oneself and society.  In "Passions Within Reason" Frank incorporates new developments from biology, psychology, and game and bargaining theory into a micro-economic theory that transcends the traditional "rational choice" model. },

How ca compliance with international treaties be explained?

Part I considers interstate threats; Part II considers commitments in international bargaining; and Part III focuses on compliance with international treaties. Throughout the book, rigorous theoretical exposition is combined with empirical examples stemming from topical current events.Game-theoretic concepts are introduced by the author in a simple and intuitive way, requiring no prior knowledge of game theory.},

abstract = {Conditional promises and threats are speech acts that are used to manipulate other people's behaviour. Studies on human reasoning typically use propositional logic to analyse what people infer from such inducements. While this approach is sufficient to uncover conceptual features of inducements, it fails to explain them. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multilevel analysis integrating motivational, linguistic, deontic, behavioural, and emotional aspects. Commonalities and differences between conditional promises and threats on various levels were examined in two experiments. The first shows that both types of inducements are understood as being complementary on the linguistic level, but not reversible, due to the specific temporal order of their actions. In addition, it gives a first assessment of emotional reactions. The second experiment investigated the novel question of whether complementary promises and threats, despite semantic differences, both imply an obligation to cooperate on the deont...},

The paper also argues that one may use epistemic criteria, such as consistency, coherence and explanatory power, to determine whether a threat is plausible, and that one may use practical considerations, such as effectiveness, proportionality, cost-effectiveness, realism and consistency, to determine whether a response to a threat is reasonable.},

I argue that this puzzle can be solved, that according to Kant transcendental philosophy is justified a priori in the sense that the only empirical information required for its justification can be derived from any possible human experience. Transcendental justification does not rely on any more particular or special observations or experiments. Philip Kitcher's general account of apriority in Kant captures this aspect of a priori knowledge. Nevertheless, I argue that Kitcher's account goes wrong in the link it specifies between apriority and certainty.},

I go on to articulate a problem for any attempt to analyze truthmaking in terms of a generic and primitive notion of grounding based on differences we find among examples of grounding. Finally, I outline a more complex view of how truthmaking and grounding could relate. On the view explored, truthmaking is a species of grounding differentiated from other species of grounding by the unique form of dependence it involves.},

The author begins by exploring the economist's assumption that action is rational if it helps to achieve the agent's goals as efficiently as possible. The assumption is explored with the aid of rational-choice theory and game-theory, but it is rejected in the end for failing to account for the elements of trust and morality which rational social life requires. A discussion of 'Rational Expectations' and of 'maximising' and 'satisficing' leads to a portrait of social actors as rational role-players. Rationality is, finally, the expression of the self in a social world. The book intervenes in intense current debates within and among several disciplines. Its concern is with the true nature of social actors and the proper character of social science. Its arguments are the more challenging for being presented in a simple, incisive and lucid prose. It will be of particular interest to philosophers, social theorists and social scientists interested in the philosophical aspects of their discipline.},

It contains only the material necessary for a course of ten, two-hour lectures plus problem classes and comes with a disk of teaching aids including pdf files of the author's own lecture presentations together with two series of weekly exercise sets with answers and two sample final exams with answers. There are at least three questions a game theory book might answer: What is game theory about? How is game theory applied? Why is game theory right? Playing for Real is perhaps the only book that attempts to answer all three questions without getting heavily mathematical. Its many problems and examples are an integral part of its approach. Just as athletes take pleasure in training their bodies, there is much satisfaction to be found in training one's mind to think in a way that is simultaneously rational and creative. With all of its puzzles and paradoxes, game theory provides a magnificent mental gymnasium for this purpose. It is the author's hope that exercising on the equipment provided by this coursepack edition of Playing for Real will bring the reader the same kind of pleasure that it has brought to so many other students.},

The second edition of the Handbook is intended to comprise some 18 volumes and will provide a very up-to-date authoritative, in-depth coverage of all major topics in philosophical logic and its applications in many cutting-edge fields relating to computer science, language, argumentation, etc. The volumes will no longer be as topic-oriented as with the first edition because of the way the subject has evolved over the last 15 years or so. However the volumes will follow some natural groupings of chapters.},

abstract = {Temporal logic comes in two varieties: linear-time temporal logic
assumes implicit universal quantification over all paths that are
generated by system moves; branching-time temporal logic allows explicit
existential and universal quantification over all paths. We introduce a
third, more general variety of temporal logic: alternating-time temporal
logic offers selective quantification over those paths that are possible
outcomes of games, such as the game in which the system and the
environment alternate moves. While linear-time and branching-time logics
are natural specification languages for closed systems, alternating-time
logics are natural specification languages for open systems. For
example, by preceding the temporal operator {\&}ldquo;eventually{\&}rdquo;
with a selective path quantifier, we can specify that in the game
between the system and the environment, the system has a strategy to
reach a certain state. Also the problems of receptiveness,
realizability, and controllability can be formulated as model-checking
problems for alternating-time formulas},

The present study sought to test this claim by assessing linguistic lateralization with the Fused Dichotic Words Test and visual temporal asymmetries with a lateralized version of an inspection-time test in a sample of 40 participants balanced for sex and handedness. We found evidence for a significant right-visual-field (left-hemisphere) advantage for accuracy on the inspection-time task, F(1,36)=4.38, P=0.043, and this asymmetry was significantly correlated with laterality scores on the linguistic dichotic-listening task, r=0.306, P{\textless}0.028 before disattenuation, and r=0.486 after disattenuation. This result supports the position that low-level temporal asymmetries are related to asymmetries in linguistic processing. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

However, persistent evidence from the research and practitioner communities from across a range of disciplines points to difficulties and problems with understanding and using diagrams. Whether it is at the application level or as an abstract definition, our existing frameworks for understanding diagrams reduce the full meaning of diagrams to a single perspective or emphasis. This paper advocates placing multi-aspectual human functioning in a central role in the development of an enriched meta-approach to understanding diagrams. Two such aspects, namely, the spatial and symbolic, are essential to the understanding of diagrams across applications.

Augmenting the diagrams with a reading tree (effectively a partial ordering of quantifiers) ensures that each diagram has a unique semantic interpretation. In this paper, we discuss examples of reasoning rules for augmented constraint diagrams which exhibit interesting properties or difficulties that can arise when developing rules for such a diagrammatic system. We do not present a complete set of rules, but investigate the generic problems arising, providing solutions. One problem corresponds to the nesting of quantifiers and another relates to the domain of universal quantification. These issues may be an important consideration in the definition of other logical reasoning systems which explicitly represent quantification diagrammatically. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.},

We confirmed that subjects find it difficult to deduce a valid conclusion, such asJulia is in Atlanta, or both Raphael is in Tacoma and Paul is in Philadelphia. In a preliminary study, the format of the premises was either verbal or diagrammatic, and the diagrams used icons to distinguish between inclusive and exclusive disjunctions. The diagrams had no effect on performance. In the main experiment, the diagrams made the alternative possibilities more explicit. The subjects responded faster (about 35 s) and drew many more valid conclusions (nearly 30{\%}) from the diagrams than from the verbal premises. These results corroborate the theory of mental models and have implications for the role of diagrams in reasoning.},

abstract = {This study addresses one of the most frequently suggested strategies for solving problems in mathematics: drawing a diagram. Professional mathematicians were asked to solve problems and their use of the strategy of drawing diagrams as they attempted to find solutions to these problems was studied. Because particular attention was paid to the reasoning processes of mathematicians while they were actually developing their proofs, the study's findings suggest ways in which experienced problem solvers used diagrams to perform specific subtasks of proof development, and how diagrams helped them complete the activities. In particular, the study suggests that mathematicians build the visual representation in steps which are clearly separated by a few moments, during which they attempt to analyze the visual representation with respect to the problem situation. This analysis consists of some well-structured processes which involve four types of actions: inferring additional consequences, elaborating on the new mathematical information, stating a new goal, and monitoring their problem-solving process. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

It is also a relatively new research area, with the first meeting of like-minded researchers interested in studying diagrams taking place in 1997. Now that diagrams research is more established, it is timely to review its scope, nature and progress. This paper reviews diagrams research over the past twelve years, as represented in the proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams. In summarising the contents of these proceedings, a taxonomy describing the scope of diagrams research is proposed, the several research issues covered are identified, and the extent to which layout and aesthetics form part of this body of research is discussed. In concluding, trends and under-represented areas are noted and discussed.

abstract = {Previous research has shown that linear reasoning about visual rela- tions is slower than reasoning about spatial or abstract relations. It has been proposed that this “visual impedance” effect occurs because visual information interferes with creating a spatial mental model of the problem. Here we exam- ine whether the construction of a spatial mental model depends on the content (visual, abstract, and spatial) of the problems and on individual differences. Half of the participants made notes during reasoning, and all were asked about the strategies they used. Accuracy on visual relations was worse than on spatial or abstract relations. When reasoners were allowed to make notes, their external representations were typically spatial (i.e., abstract diagrams), and accuracy was higher and depended less on ability measures than for those who did not make notes; yet the visual impedance effect remained. These data imply reasoners typically externalize their representations of linear reasoning problems as dia- grams, and with these diagrams, problem solving is less effortful.},

But despite the obvious importance of visual images in human cognitive activities, visual representation remains a second-class citizen in both the theory and practice of mathematics.

abstract = {Spatial competence is a central aspect of human adaptation. To understand human cognitive functioning, we must understand how people code the locations of things, how they navigate in the world, and how they represent and mentally manipulate spatial information. Until recently three approaches have dominated thinking about spatial development. Followers of Piaget claim that infants are born without knowledge of space or a conception of permanent objects that occupy space. They develop such knowledge through experience and manipulation of their environment. Nativists suggest that the essential aspects of spatial understanding are innate and that biological maturation of specific brain areas can account for whatever aspects of spatial development are not accounted for at birth. The Vygotskan approach emphasizes the cultural transmission of spatial skills.Nora Newcombe and Janellen Huttenlocher argue for an interactionist approach to spatial development that incorporates and integrates essential insights of the classic three approaches. They show how biological preparedness interacts with the spatial environment that infants encounter after birth to create spatial development and mature spatial competence. Topics covered include spatial coding during infancy and childhood; the early origins of coding distance in continuous space, of coding location with respect to distal external landmarks, and of hierarchical combination of information; the mental processes that operate on stored spatial information; spatial information as encoded in models and maps; and spatial information as encoded in language. In conclusion, the authors discuss their account of spatial development in relation to various approaches to cognitive development in other domains, including quantitative development, theory of mind, and language acquisition.},
